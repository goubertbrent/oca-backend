<p>The Agreement is exclusively governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Belgium, excluding its conflict of law principles. Any dispute in connection with or arising from the Agreement shall be finally adjudicated by the competent courts of Ghent, Belgium.</p>

<p>You agree to bring any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the Website, the Services or this Agreement, to the extent permitted hereunder or under mandatory applicable law, within one (1) year from the date on which the cause of action arose, failure of which shall result in such claim or such cause of action being permanently barred.</p>

<b>18. Entire agreement and Severability</b>

<p>The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Mobicage concerning the Website and the Services. If any provision of the Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of the Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, and the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision which most closely matches the intent of the original provision. You acknowledge and agree that a printed copy of the Agreement and of any notice given in electronic or written form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings relating to the Agreement to the same extent as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.</p>

<b>19. Waiver</b>

<p>No waiver by Mobicage of any term of the Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Mobicage's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms and Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

<b>20. Modification of Terms and Conditions</b>

 <p>Mobicage reserves the right to amend the Agreement at any time. We therefore encourage and urge you to regularly check the Agreement  for any changes. Your access to the Website and/or use of the Services following any amendment of the Agreement will signify your acceptance of its revised terms.</p>

<b>21. Miscellaneous</b>

<p>Mobicage shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond Mobicage's reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation (including "line-noise" interference). No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of the Agreement or you accessing the Website and/or using the Services.</p>
